# Changelog

## v1.2.0 — 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Reminders system** (`reminders.py`) — SQLite-backed persistent reminders with 3 types:
  - `plain` — bot sends raw text at the time, no LLM
  - `urgent_llm` — at the time, Claude is triggered (via inject if busy, new turn if idle) to formulate and send the reminder
  - `lazy_llm` — silent at fire time; injected into the next user prompt as context
- **Universal repeat**: `repeat_interval` (`30m`/`2h`/`1d`/`1w`/`3mo`) + optional `repeat_at_time` (`HH:MM`) for daily/weekly alignment.
- **Lazy TTL**: `lazy_llm` reminders not delivered within 24h auto-promote to `urgent_llm`.
- **Missed delivery on startup**: groups missed reminders by type and dispatches accordingly (plain → digest, urgent_llm → Claude turn, lazy_llm → mark fired for next user message).
- **MCP tools**: `create_reminder`, `list_reminders`, `cancel_reminder`, `update_reminder`.
- **Time prefix in prompts**: every prompt now starts with `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM +0700]` so Claude has accurate current time in user's timezone (Krsk UTC+7).

### Removed
- `schedule_message` MCP tool — replaced by `create_reminder` (persistent across restarts, supports repeat/cancel/update).

### Changed
- `system_prompt.txt` — added TIME & TIMEZONE and REMINDERS sections explaining the 3 types and how to interpret fired reminder blocks.
- `requirements.txt` — added `python-dateutil` for `relativedelta` (correct month arithmetic).

## v1.1.0 — 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **Stale response buffer** — injection messages no longer leave orphaned responses in the SDK buffer. Switched from `receive_response()` (stops at first ResultMessage) to `receive_messages()` with manual ResultMessage counting. Each `query()` and `inject()` increments expected results counter; the loop breaks only when all results are consumed.
- **Injection responses merged into single bubble** — each Claude turn (main response + injection responses) now finalizes as a separate Telegram message via `turn_done` signal.

### Changed
- `claude_session.py` — `receive_messages()` + `_expected_results` counter instead of `receive_response()`. Added `_is_processing` flag to prevent injection after response completes.
- `bot.py` — handle `turn_done` chunk type to finalize text between turns.

### How injection works now
1. User sends message → `query()` → `_expected_results = 1`
2. User sends follow-up while Claude is thinking → `inject()` → `_expected_results += 1`
3. `receive_messages()` streams all responses; each `ResultMessage` decrements counter
4. When counter hits 0 → break (all responses consumed, no stale buffer)
5. Each intermediate `ResultMessage` triggers `turn_done` → text finalized as separate TG message
